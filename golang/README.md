# AESEncryptDecrypt

There are two modes in this program which are encrypt and decrypt.

## Encrypt

Put your secret in secret.txt and put your text that you want to encrypt in input.txt then run the command

```bash
go run aes.go encrypt
```

Or you can build the go file and then run .exe file instead

## Decrypt
Put your secret in the same way above and put the encrypted text (hex) in the input.txt and then run the command

```bash
go run aes.go decrypt
```
